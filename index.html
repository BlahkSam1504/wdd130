            Hello! My name is Samuel Olagbaju and I am from Osun, Nigeria. I enjoy reading
            and learning new things. I am currently studying web design and development at BYU.
            I am excited to learn more about web development and design. I am looking forward to
            creating
            my own website and learning more about the industry. I am excited to see what the future
            holds
            for me.
